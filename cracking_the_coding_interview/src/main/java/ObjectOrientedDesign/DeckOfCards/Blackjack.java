//deck is made with blackjack in mind
//to actually implement, main things would be:
//user can bet money, application can evaluate whether they have won or lost and change money based on that
//clear hands and bets after someone has won
//whether the cards go back in the deck and how to handle this
//whether the user is playing against anyone, is this the computer or other players?
